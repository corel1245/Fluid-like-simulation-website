# Fluid-like-simulation-website

The website is focused on creating the best fluid-lile simulation experience possible.
It has multiple options (balls, fluid, other things...), a sleek techno vibe, an advanced option to interact with the variables and create the perfect simulation.
It can feature lifetime objects, but those should be only optional; it has to work both on mobile and pc.
Find a way to make it really optimised and really impressive, no half-baked features, and real fluid-like simulation.
